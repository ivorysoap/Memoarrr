- [x] Set up GitHub repo
- [ ] Figure out abstract factory design pattern

===MAIN===

===PLAYER===

===CARD===

===REWARD===

===DECK/CARDDECK/REWARDDECK===

- [ ] Implement Deck and CardDeck methods

===BOARD===

- [ ] Add exception (OutOfRange) for all methods
- [ ] Add exception (NoMoreCards) for Board class
- [ ] Add << operator implementation


===GAME===

- [ ] Issue: Game::getCard and Game::setCard , which are wrappers for Board::getCard and Board::setCard, were showing errors unless I made Board::getCard and Board::setCard static methods.  (Don't think it makes a difference since Board should never be instantiated more than once)
